MVP: There will be a button create a character and store and assign them a level. There will be a button to create additional characters and continue storing them. There will be buttons to remove characters from the party. There will be a tracker that shows you your combat rating based off of your party, and a button underneath to generate an encounter. Hitting the button will generate a monster with the appropriate CR to fight.

post-mvp: expand on the CR method to be based off of total xp and possibly return multiple enemies instead of just 1. Show images of the monster/s selected. track more party info.
